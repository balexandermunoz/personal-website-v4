[Project awarded as "Most Public Impact"](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6963323267336048640/).  
Well, in a nutshell, this project is a whole system of historical analysis and recommendations focused on schools that wanted to improve their average SABER (ICFES) test scores.

It was built with data from the SABER tests from 2000 to 2021.
The data contains a lot of socio-economic, cultural, and educational data of the students taking the tests, and the results of that test.
